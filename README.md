# AdventureWorks Data Visualization Project

This project showcases the application of core data analyst competencies using **Microsoft Excel** and the **AdventureWorks** dataset. It demonstrates how raw business data is transformed into a structured, analysis-ready format via **Power Query**, then explored through **Pivot Table-based exploratory analysis**, and finally communicated through a variety of well-designed visualizations to support data-driven business decisions.
